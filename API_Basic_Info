//What is API in programming point of view?
According to Wikipedia: 
An application programming interface (API) is a particular set of rules ('code') and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. It serves as an interface between different software programs and facilitates their interaction, similar to the way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computers.

The goal of the API is to perform described services when asked in specific ways. It is being used when two or more spearate system need to work together to achieve something they can't finish alone.

First-party API: 
The First-party APIs are API that are developed internally which means they are developed in-house. These API are developed using in-house system and resources.
