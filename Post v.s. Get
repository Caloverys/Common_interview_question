/* 

What is the difference between POST method and GET method when retrieve data from API?

*/


/*

GET method is being when requesting data from the serever, it means we want to view something without changing it.
POST method is always being used when we want to change/update some data

In simple term:
GET when you want to retrieve data (GET DATA).
POST when you want to send data (POST DATA).

When submitting data to server:
 The data will be included in the url when you use GET Method, but URL lenght is limited so it should be used when there are only few data parameters.
 The data will be included inside the http request body when we use POST method
